Complete the code, the variables i, d and s are already declared and initialized for you. 

You must:

1.-Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2.-Readlines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3.-Use the + operator to perform the following operations:

    a) Print the sum of `i` plus your int variable on a new line.
    b) Print the sum of `d` plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
