# Operators

You work with:

1. Unary: Operates 1 operand
2. Binary: Operates 2 operands
3. Ternary: Operates 3 operands

## Arithmetic Operators

The binary operators used for arithmetic are as follows:

- + : Addition
- - : Substraction
- * : Multiplication
- / : Division
- % : Remainder (modulo)


Also we can use this operators to indicate the follows:


- +: A binary operator used for String concatenation
- ++: This unary operator is used to preincrement (increment by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postincrement (increment by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.
- --: This unary operator is used to predecrement (decrement by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postdecrement (decrement by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.
- !: This unary operator means not (negation). It's used before a variable or logical expression that evaluates to true or false.
- ==: This binary operator is used to check the equality of 2 primitives.
- !=: This binary operator is used to check the inequality of 2 primitives.
- <, >, <=, >=: These are the respective binary operators for less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, and are used to compare two operands.
- &&, ||: These are the respective binary operators used to perform logical AND and logical OR operations on two boolean (i.e.: true or false) statements.
